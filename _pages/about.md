<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>

DHInfra.at serves as the central hub for Digital Humanities infrastructure in Austria, connecting tools, documentation, and resources across [Austrian institutions](/partners). Our mission is to provide researchers with access to specialized digital infrastructure, promote resource sharing, and foster collaboration across institutional boundaries.

<h2 id="structure">Infrastructure Structure</h2>

The DHInfra.at ecosystem consists of two main components:

1. **[Existing Resources](/resources)** - Already implemented infrastructure that consortium members make available to the broader digital humanities community. These resources include specialized equipment, software implementations, and expertise that can be accessed through partner institutions.

2. **[Planned Infrastructure](/infrastructure)** - New infrastructure initiatives being developed through the DHInfra.at consortium. These developments focus on five core areas:
   - Data Capture and Enhanced Image Sensing
   - Repository Systems
   - Machine Learning Infrastructure
   - Infrastructure as a Service
   - Free and Open Source Software

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits for Researchers</h2>

DHInfra.at offers three key advantages for digital humanities researchers:

- **Shared Infrastructure**: Access specialized equipment and technical expertise that would be difficult for individual projects to acquire
- **Collaborative Approach**: Connect with a network of DH practitioners across Austrian institutions
- **Practical Support**: Benefit from use cases, implementation examples, and direct assistance for your projects

Coming soon: A dedicated **CLARIAH Helpdesk** will provide centralized support for all infrastructure needs, with staff to assist researchers and coordinate with partner institutions. [Learn more about the helpdesk](/governance#helpdesk).
