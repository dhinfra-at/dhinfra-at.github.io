<h2 id="current-status">Current Status</h2>

DHInfra.at is actively developing its governance framework, which will be implemented with the start of regular operations. The concept is being carefully crafted to address the challenges of managing shared digital humanities infrastructure across multiple Austrian institutions.

We are currently focusing on concrete implementations, templates for day-to-day Ops, governance scopes, and a legal and financial framework succeeding the dedicated project funding.

<h2 id="key-focus-areas">Key Focus Areas</h2>

We are working on several critical aspects:

- **Decision-Making**: Creating clear processes for infrastructure-related decisions and strategic planning
- **Resource Allocation**: Developing fair-use policies and transparent allocation mechanisms for computational resources, especially for high-demand GPU infrastructure
- **Support Structure**: Establishing a multi-level support system that utilizes expertise across partner institutions
- **Financial Model**: To support the above, designing sustainable funding mechanisms that consider both base contributions and usage-based components

<h2 id="helpdesk">CLARIAH Helpdesk</h2>

A central component of our governance and support structure will be the establishment of a dedicated DHInfra helpdesk as part of a larger CLARIAH helpdesk initiative. This service will feature:

- At least one full-time position (or equivalent distributed across multiple part-time roles)
- Coordination and direction functions to delegate specialized requests to partner institutions
- Direct support for researcher inquiries about infrastructure access and utilization
- Technical assistance for digital humanities projects across Austria
- Integration with the broader European CLARIAH support network

The helpdesk will serve as the first point of contact for researchers and will play a key role in ensuring that infrastructure resources are efficiently utilized and properly supported.

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>

The governance framework is being developed through an iterative process involving all consortium partners. We expect to:

1. Complete the detailed concept by late 2025
2. Conduct stakeholder consultations and refinements
3. Implement the framework with the start of regular operations (July 2026 latest)


_This page will be updated as the governance framework develops. For questions or input, please contact your institutional representative or the project lead._
