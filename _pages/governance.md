title: Governance
subtitle: DHInfra.at Management Framework

## Current Status

DHInfra.at is actively developing its governance framework, which will be implemented with the start of regular operations. The concept is being carefully crafted to address the challenges of managing shared digital humanities infrastructure across multiple Austrian institutions.

We are currently focusing on concrete implementations, templates for day-to-day Ops, governance scopes, and a legal and financial framework succeeding the dedicated project funding.

## Key Focus Areas

We are working on several critical aspects:

- **Decision-Making**: Creating clear processes for infrastructure-related decisions and strategic planning
- **Resource Allocation**: Developing fair-use policies and transparent allocation mechanisms for computational resources, especially for high-demand GPU infrastructure
- **Support Structure**: Establishing a multi-level support system that utilizes expertise across partner institutions
- **Financial Model**: To support the above, designing sustainable funding mechanisms that consider both base contributions and usage-based components

## Timeline

The governance framework is being developed through an iterative process involving all consortium partners. We expect to:

1. Complete the detailed concept by late 2025
2. Conduct stakeholder consultations and refinements
3. Implement the framework with the start of regular operations (July 2026 latest)
