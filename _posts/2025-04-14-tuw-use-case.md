# TU Wien Computer Vision Lab Requirements Analysis

Through our survey with TU Wien's Computer Vision Lab, we identified a clear need for mobile scanning solutions in cultural heritage digitization. The lab's research in image science and collection studies requires specialized equipment that can be deployed directly in archives and collections.

## Identified Requirements

The primary infrastructure needs center around mobility and versatility. Researchers require systems that can be transported to various locations, ideally fitting into one or two cases with tripods, while still supporting large-format materials up to A2 size. The ability to perform multispectral imaging is crucial for their work, particularly in analyzing historical materials and artworks. Equally important is the need for systems that are straightforward to set up and operate, enabling researchers to focus on their work rather than technical complexities.

Three main use cases emerged from the survey. For image science and collection studies, there's a strong need for scanning large flat materials with multispectral capabilities and high resolution. In painting restoration, specialized mobile imaging solutions are required for on-site analysis and documentation. The game research area highlighted a currently unmet need for 3D scanning capabilities, which would enable new research directions in their field.

## Implementation Response

In response to these requirements, TU Wien has implemented two complementary systems that address most of the identified needs. For detailed technical specifications of these solutions, please visit our [Data Capture and Enhanced Image Sensing](/capture) resources page.

## Unmet Requirements

While the current infrastructure addresses many needs, the survey revealed some persistent gaps, particularly in 3D scanning capabilities for game research and certain specialized scanning requirements. These areas represent potential future directions for infrastructure development.
