The University of Vienna participated in three online discussions in 2024 to explore potential areas of collaboration within DHInfra. Representatives from multiple faculties and central services identified several possibilities for future cooperation.

The university's Media Lab occasionally has available capacity in its Motion Capture facilities that could potentially be used by consortium members under negotiated terms. Similar opportunities might exist with specialized equipment for numismatic photography and archaeological landscape prospection (ground radar), though further contact with the respective infrastructure representatives would be needed.

Regarding software, individual projects at the university work with Semantic MediaWiki, and there is recurring interest in WissKI. While the exact nature of participation in DHInfra for these areas needs clarification, the university suggested developing shared criteria for evaluating open-source applications, particularly regarding data protection and long-term sustainability.

In the area of machine learning, the university is currently testing a new central machine (as of summer 2024) while also maintaining some decentralized GPU clusters at various institutes. While the university collaborates with the Vienna Scientific Cluster (VSC), this partnership primarily serves non-humanities computing needs. One potential use case is the newly digitized "Gaupresse-Archiv" at the Institute of Contemporary History, which could benefit from topic modeling capabilities.
