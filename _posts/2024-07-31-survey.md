In collaboration with CLARIAH-AT, DHInfra.at conducted a survey regarding the acquisition of computing hardware specifically for storage and artificial intelligence applications, aimed at addressing needs not currently met by individual institutions.

The survey is now closed. We thank all participants for their valuable input. The collected use cases and requirements are being processed, and we will publish key findings in upcoming blog posts.

For any questions, please contact your [institutional representative](/partners).
